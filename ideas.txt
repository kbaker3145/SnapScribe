DIVISION

index.js
- client side
- handles file selection + sends file to server
- sends the image file to the server using a POST request
- receives extracted text from server and display in text box

server.js

HOW JESUS DID it

- inputPDF gets a change like an upload and its processed with uploadPDF
- submit button gets clicked
- convertTextToMp3 function to convert whatever text was in resultText
    - also has the splitting text into cunks and then converting to base64
    - calls downloadMP3
- downloadMP3 function does smth I don't get with filenaming and maybe adding it?
